# Jupiter-Orbital-Motion-Estimation-Using-Curve-Fitting-in-Python
This project focuses on modeling the geocentric trajectory of Jupiter and voyager 1 using sinusoidal and hybrid curve-fitting techniques. By leveraging real ephemeris data, the motion of Jupiter is approximated through both single and double sinusoidal models and voyager 1 with both linear and sinusoidal.

The goal is to reconstruct the planet's position over time along the x, y, and z axes using non-linear least squares fitting (SciPy), and visualize these approximations with respect to time. The final output provides Cartesian and polar coordinates, as well as the distance in astronomical units (AU).
